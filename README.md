# IMDB_Analysis-MapReduce

There are many instances when a person directs a movie, TV series etc., in which he also acts.
For example, Ben Affleck directed and starred in the 2012 movie Argo.
This is the  Map/Reduce program to list the names of people who have directed and acted in the same IMDb title (of any type), at least 100 times.
